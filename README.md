## Description
This project is a command line application that can help you track and manage your employees. This is a java script program that uses inquirer, MySQL, and console.table to ask questions and display information. This project was hard for me in that it works with some packages that I had not worked with before. After figuring out parts of code though using activities from class the code actually came to gether very repetitively. Because this is not a deployed site I have attached a video tutorial bellow.
