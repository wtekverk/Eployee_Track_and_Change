## Description
This project is a command line application that can help you track and manage your employees. This is a java script program that uses inquirer, MySQL, and console.table to ask questions and display information. This project was hard for me in that it works with some packages that I had not worked with before. After figuring out parts of code though using activities from class the code actually came to gether very repetitively. Because this is not a deployed site I have attached a video tutorial bellow.

## Installation
This is not a deployed side to in order to run this application it will need to be forked from the origional github repo. The user will have to run `npm i` to initialize all of the needed packages and lastly the user will need to run the sql files within their workbench. Once that is done the user only has to type `node server.js` into the terminal to start the application. 

## Usage
Once this application is installed correctly the user starts the program by entering the terminal command `node server.js`. I have attached a demonstration below.
